    "# Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to provide detailed methodology on how N3C RECOVER's Long COVID algorithm (in PySpark) is implemented within Researcher Workbench Jupyter Notebook using Python Programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The XGBoost machine learning model was used to identify potential patients with PASC/Long COVID, which was initially published by [Emily et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35589549/). These models were initially implemented within the *All of Us* Controlled Tier data (C2022Q2R2; v6), which was last refreshed on June 22, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show the following:\n",
    "1. All the libraries that are needed to implement N3C RECOVER's Long COVID algorithm within Researcher Workbench.   \n",
    "2. Detailed steps on how the ML model was implemented in the *All of Us* Researcher Workbench using Python programming language. \n",
    "3. How to compute demographic characteristics of the final analytical sample on N3C RECOVER's Long COVID algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "What libraries and software packages are needed to implement the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The orginial code was in PySpark and we present all steps needed to run this algorithm within pandas. Further, we show detailed methodology on how to create the analytical dataset, which meets the criteria on which the alogrithm can be applied. Specifically, the model was run on participants who were identified as having a COVID positive value based on \"condition\" and \"laboratory\" results (in the Electronic Health Records (EHR)). Additionally, participants needed to have enough medication or diagnostic data (i.e., one positive PCR or antigen test, at least 145 days have passed since COVID-19 index date and who have had at least one healthcare encounter between days 45 and 300 from their COVID-19 index date)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the distribution of probabilities of having Long COVID using the algorithm and the demographic characteristics of analytical sample."
